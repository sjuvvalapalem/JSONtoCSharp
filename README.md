# JSONtoCSharp

A sample project written in C# .NET 4.5 to show how easy it is to take a simple JSON and then convert it to a C# object. 

Basically you are creating a class and then loading the json to an array of that object, that way you could easily access the data.

Please leave a message or open a issue if you have any queries.
